## Problem Definition

### Objectives

A major travel company has tasked us to develop an information system to improve the operation of their in-house call management centre (CMC).

The system will dynamically match and assign inbound and outbound customer calls to Relationship Managers (RM) according to skills and profiles. A customer profile will be automatically made using the Profiler Tool and RM profile is initialised at hiring. RM profiles will adjust according to RMs performance in selling packages and in serving customers effectively and efficiently.

The system dials outbound calls automatically according to a customer target list generated by the system. This list consists of tuples of information in the form of *<potential customer, product proposed>* and it is provided to a specific RM. The system retrieves the customer details from the database and provides the RM guidelines and a script to help provide improved service to the end customer.

Inbound customer calls contacts the CMC which has its own private branch exchange to route calls. A customer will get a score from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product (e.g. repeat customers may have a higher score, customers from particular postcodes may have lower scores, etc...). A customer with higher scores is served first. A skill score is allocated to a RM based on their previous call duration and profile.

During busy times a customer is directed to an interactive voice response unit promoting them for options. It may ask a few questions before redirecting the customer to the automatic call distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM.

### Point of View (POV) Statements

POV defines the problem to solve in the ideation phase in the Design Thinking process. A focused POV will assist in generating a greater quantity of quality solutions, focused on our users, their needs, and our insights about them during ideation. Forming a POV Madlib in the following sentence: [User . . . (descriptive)] needs [Need . . . (verb)] because [Insight . . . (compelling)] creates an actionable problem statement.

| User | Need | Insight |
|-|-|-|
| RMs who perform sales of holiday packages | To be matched with customers according to their profile and skills | RMs want to be matched with customers based on their profiles due to the increased chance of a sale |
| RMs who are outbound calling | A system to automatically dial and generate a customer target list, displays the customer details and provides the RM with guidelines and a script | RMs want to call potential customers who have an increased chance of purchasing from them based on their profiles |
| RM recruits | Initial profiling (using the Profiler Tool) to build a profile and skill matrix | This initial profile will adjust according to RM performance and match RMs with suitable customers so they can serve customers effectively and efficiently |
| RMs who are outbound calling | Customer details, guidelines and a script | To improve service to the end-customer, the RMs will be matched based on profiles and given appropriate and assistive sales information |
| Travel Company Management| To use CMC software to produce sales reports | Management utilise reports to see operational performance and can respond appropriately to potential issues |
| Customer who want to purchase a holiday package through the CMC | To be matched according to RM skills and customer profile |Customers want to be matched to RMs based on their profiles. RMs are more convincing to a customer if they match social and cultural attributes |
| Travel company | An information system to improve the operation (call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls) of their in-house CMC | The information system will provide assistance to RMs in serving their end-customers (or potential customers) and will match RMs and customers according to RMs skills and customers profiles |
| Customers who are likely to purchase a holiday package | To be prioritised and served by an RM based on skill and profile match | Scoring customers will ensure that likely customers will receive the best customer experience |
| Customers experiencing long wait times | An Interactive Voice Response unit prompting them for information and redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor which will route the call to the first available appropriate RM | Customers experiencing long hold times are likely to hang up - keeping customers engaged is important. The more information available to the RM (and CMC system) enables them to skillfully sell the product |

### Backlog

### Reflection

We used the Design Thinking methodology to design a CMC solution to solve the problems faced by the Travel Company.

Step 1 was to gain an empathic understanding of the problem we were trying to solve. Empathy is important in human-centered design processes and allowed us to set aside our original assumptions and gain insight into the stakeholders. We gained an understanding of the users feelings, their needs and the problems that underline the development of the CMC system.

Instead of interviews, we analysed the project specification and noted our assumptions. Empathy maps have been valuable in attaining an alternative perspective of between the RM and end-customer relationship. We sought to understand and empathise with the feelings, needs and wants of the stakeholders of the new CMC system. Interestingly, the end-customer did not have a strong relationship with the CMC system - they are strongly bound to the relationship with their RM. The empathic phase identified the key stakeholders of this new CMC system.

Step 2 was to combine and analyse the information discovered during the empathise stage. POV and HMW statements analysed the core problems that we identified. POV statements will assist in generating a greater quantity of quality solutions, focused on our users, their needs, and our insights about them during ideation. HMW statements analysed the POV statements and aimed to assist in brainstorming potential solutions.

## Competitive Advantages and Possible Effects of Failure
The production and upgrade of the travel company’s in-house call management system has been purpose built to streamline the sales making process with an overall goal of bosting profits. Listed Below are a number of intended benefits this project should have on the operation of the company.

<ins>Increased Call Processing Speed</ins>  
The obvious first intentional benefit of the new and improved system is to streamline the call management process and provide the company with a competitive advantage over similar competing companies. By streamlining this process, they are able to increase their call processing speed by removing the need to assign calls to Relationship Managers (RM) manually. Furthermore, this allows for a cutback of total hold times, hence preventing customers from leaving a que due to a long period hold. Ultimately, a net increase in sales should be taken due a higher maintenance of customer call.
 
<ins>Reduced Labour Requirements</ins>  
Another benefit resulting from the automaticity of the new call management system, is the reduction of the workforce. This results from the new automatic allocation of calls to RM’s limiting the need for this work to be done manually and hence reducing the cost of operation. Furthermore, the new system also limits the workforce by again automatically generating more efficient out-going calling lists that RM’s use to prompt sale.

<ins>Increased Chance of Sales</ins>  
Another competitive advantage that may be provided is an increase in the chance of successful sales. This is generated by a number of contributing factors including the matching of RM’s to a customer. By matching an RM’s familiarities with a customer needs, RM’s are able to become far more convincing throughout the process of the sale hence increasing the chance of it going through. Furthermore, by ensuring that repeat customers talk to the same RM where possible, a relationship can be formed again improving the chance of a sale. Additionally, the new systems ability to prioritise customers based on the chance of a sale means that less, high chance customer calls are lost while on hold.

<ins>Increased Staff Performance</ins>  
Finally, Increased staff performance is a particularly helpful advantage of the system as it allows for more efficient, friendly and motivated staff making the calls. This would begin to show as staff would learn that they’re being scored based on call performance. The knowledge of this causes a certain amount of pressure on staff to perform in a more efficient and sales focused way that limits paying staff that don’t work well for the company. Additionally, this system also allows staff to increase their performance as with the knowledge of a staff members abilities, the system can assign calls where a staff member may perform well.

<ins>Risk of Failure</ins>  
While these improvements to the system are encouraging, a number of risks must be considered as a result of system failure. Below are number of results that may occur should the system fail immediately after installation or randomly during its lifetime:
* Lack of training for future employed staff on manual allocation jobs may result in a severe over burdening of the team should the system fail.
* If the system were to fail during its lifetime, there would be a very significant decrease in productivity as hold times increase and repeat customers are lost to competition.
* Should the system fail immediately after installation the company may find that they are being outperformed by their competition developing similar systems.
